# Stacks and Queues
## This application will demonstrate the uses of the stack and queue data structure by implementing them from scratch using linked lists.


What I changed:
- Both codes from banches Juilius and Peter included implentation for using the include <stack> & include <queue> libraries, of which we were not supposed to use.
- Redid Code to fit within requiremsnts and code given to us by Mehri, wasn't a terribly long fix to do, but otherwise should all be done.
- Comments should be within the code and if yall have any questions I'm avaible to answer them. Will also be emailing yall and update saying I'm done.
